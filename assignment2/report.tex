\section{Dictionaries}

Our solution revolves around two data structures \texttt{node} and \texttt{dicttree}. \texttt{node} contains \emph{key, value, left, right} and \texttt{dicttree} contains \emph{root, compare} where compare is a function that will defines how comparing should be handled.

\subsection{create-dictionary}
\texttt{create-dictionary} is defined as a constructor for our \texttt{dicttree} structure.

\subsection{lookup}


\subsection{update}

\subsection{fold}

\subsection{rebalance}
\texttt{rebalance} balances our tree as a AVL-tree and we chose AVL because of how easy it is to implement.

\subsection{keys}
\texttt{keys} make use of our \texttt{fold}-function together with the \texttt{print-keys }function  that just prints the current key.

\subsection{samekeys}
Since our \texttt{fold-aux} makes sure the tree is always sorted the same way. \texttt{samekeys} compares the keys \texttt{dict1} and \texttt{dict2} from the \texttt{keys}-function and check if they are the same.
